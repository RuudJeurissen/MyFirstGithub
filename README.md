# MyFirstGithub
My first gitHub
This is a test-project, containing hardly (I mean NO) real code.
Now I edit the test in the Master branch.
This code is edited in the "Feature 1" branch.
Now edit in the cloud, while committing locally too.
Edit this locally and do a local commit.
Editted through Github Desktop.


And a 2nd commit!!


Changed on master-branch.
