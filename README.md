# MyFirstGithub
My first gitHub
This is a test-project, containing hardly (I mean NO) real code.
Now I edit the test in the Master branch.

Add this on master.
This code is edited in the "Feature 1" branch.
Now edit in the cloud, while committing locally too.
Edit this locally and do a local commit.
Editted through Github Desktop.


And a 2nd commit!!


Changed on master-branch.
Edit this locally and do a local commit.
